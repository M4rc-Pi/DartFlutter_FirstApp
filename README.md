# RECIPE APP



## Objective

This project consists of a mobile application developed in Dart/Flutter that aims to be a search engine for different types of recipes with detailed information about them. The idea of this application is that it serves as an "exercise" to familiarize myself with the development of applications with Dart / Flutter.



## Technical Aspects

I will be using the following tools:

- **Dart** language with **Flutter** framework.

- **Android Studio** AVD

- **Visual Studio Code**

- **Git**
